    The most interesting insights to come from this data exploration effort were 
    to see that the countries that arguably had the most influence in the creation 
    of alcohol do not have a heavy drinking culture in the modern day. 
    Iraq was once part of Ancient Mesopotamia. But now in the modern day, 
    this is a country that has incorporated Islamic law in their legal statutes 
    in some capacity. This bans the consumption of alcohol.  
    
    Despite this, it is intriguing to uncover the major influence ancient global 
    trade has had on the patterns we observe in the present day. Our exploratory 
    data analysis revealed that European nations indulge the most in alcoholic 
    beverages. Besides the early origins in Greece, alcoholâ€™s origins mainly 
    stemmed from Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and South America. This goes to 
    show how connected and culturally aware the people of the world can be through 
    trade and communication of goods.
